# ProtocoleDataScience
package in Python 3.6 emcompasses FeatureEngineering, FeatureImportance, MachineLearning for classification, Hyperparameters optimization, model performance metrics
Currently solely based on ATP.csv kaggle dataset  

Repository contains:
- pre_proc_lib.py
- ML_lib_hyperparams_optim.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)
--> using Python GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- ML_Models_Performances_Lib.ipynb
--> models implemented using Python sklearn lib

Requirement:
- Need to download ATP.csv kaggle dataset

Coming soon:
- package to be generalized for manaing any dataset by the means of a yaml configuration file
for listing column names to be dropped ffrom the dataset priori any dataprocessing
